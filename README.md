- Allows you to input any API URL and cookie string
- Displays the fetched JSON data in a clean HTML table

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- Axios
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## üì¶ How to Use

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
   npm install express axios
```
2. **Run the server:**

## üß† Notes

- This project sets `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to allow self-signed HTTPS requests.  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This should not be used in production as it disables certificate verification.

- This tool is useful for:
  - Testing APIs that **require cookies for authentication**
  - APIs that **lack proper CORS headers** and block requests from browsers
